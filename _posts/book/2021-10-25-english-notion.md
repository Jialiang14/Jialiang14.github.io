## 表述

1. For each UAP, we evaluate its fooling rate on the model it was generated from (white-box
   attack) and on the three remaining models (transfer attack).
2. Our results show that models trained on Stylized-ImageNet are still **as vulnerable to** these UAPs **as** models trained on ImageNet.
3. For transfer attacks, where the UAP is generated from a model different from the evaluated one, the fooling rate consistently rises for " > 4.
4. Particularly, in case of critical applications that involve safety and security, reliable models need to be deployed to stand against the strong adversarial attacks. Thus, the effect of these structured perturbations has to be studied thoroughly in order to develop dependable machine learning systems.  需要研究对抗样本的原因
5. We train G in order to be able to generate the UAPs that can fool the target classifier over the underlying data distribution.
6. Hence, diagonal entries denote the white-box adversarial attacks and the off diagonal entries denote the black-box attacks.
