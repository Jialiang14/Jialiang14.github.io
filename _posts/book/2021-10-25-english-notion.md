## 表述

1. For each UAP, we evaluate its fooling rate on the model it was generated from (white-box attack) and on the three remaining models (transfer attack).
2. Our results show that models trained on Stylized-ImageNet are still **as vulnerable to** these UAPs **as** models trained on ImageNet.
3. For transfer attacks, where the UAP is generated from a model different from the evaluated one, the fooling rate consistently rises for " > 4.
4. Particularly, in case of critical applications that involve safety and security, reliable models need to be deployed to stand against the strong adversarial attacks. Thus, the effect of these structured perturbations has to be studied thoroughly in order to develop dependable machine learning systems.  需要研究对抗样本的原因
5. We train G in order to be able to generate the UAPs that can fool the target classifier over the underlying data distribution.
6. Hence**, diagonal entries** denote the white-box adversarial attacks and the off diagonal entries denote the black-box attacks.
7. It computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to pixels, and moves a single step based on the sign of the gradient.
8. To verify this latter claim
9. universal perturbations computed for the VGG-19 network have a fooling ratio above 53% for all other tested architectures.
10. Adversarial samples also possess the characteristic of transferability, which means adversarial sample generated for attacking one model could also mislead another model.
11. In this paper we present the first comprehensive evaluation of transferability of evasion and poisoning availability attacks,
12. as formulated in [42] and in follow-up work (e.g., [33]).
13. It is not difficult to see that， for  ...
14. In Fig. 6a we report the mean test error at e=1 for each target model against the size of its input gradients (S, averaged on the test samples and on the 10 runs).
15. A visual **inspection** of the poisoning digits  中毒数字的目视检查
16. The value in the i-th row and j-th column of each heatmap matrix is the proportion of the adversarial examples successfully transferred to target model j out of all adversarial examples generated by source model i (including both successful and failed attacks on the source model). 混淆矩阵的解释
17. In order to assess texture and shape biases, we conducted six major experiments **along with** three control experiments, which are described in the Appendix.

26. has introduced an efficient one-step attack method, widely known as the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM). [27] has extended the basic FGSM to its iterative variant, i.e. I-FGSM,
27. For consistency we follow prior works [38, 46, 41] and adopt l∞ = 10/255. Unless otherwise specified, the UAP in this work is by default untargeted
28. Concurrent to [46], [20] adopts a similar approach.
29. Our results align well with [61] that identifies frequency as a factor for the classwise
    robustness gap against targeted UAP
30. Overall, there is a general consensus among the UAP researchers that crafting UAP with limited or no data is challenging.
31. For a detailed description of their various methods, we refer the readers to [31].
32. Universal adversarial perturbation (UAP), i.e. a single perturbation to fool the network for most images, is widely recognized as a more practical attack because the UAP can be generated beforehand and applied directly during the attack stage.  通用对抗扰动的描述
33. image-agnostic perturbations that cause most natural images to be misclassified.
34. Universal adversarial perturbations exhibit many interesting properties such as their
    universality across networks, which means that a perturbation constructed using one DNN will perform relatively well for other DNNs.
35. Our analysis with UAPs reveals the extent to which increased shape-bias improves adversarial robustness of models to universal attacks.  我们对 UAP 的分析揭示了增加的形状偏差在多大程度上提高了模型对普遍攻击的对抗性鲁棒性。

38. The PASCAL VOC dataset contains 20 object categories. The majority of images in the PASCAL VOC dataset have 1 to 5 object instances, on average, 1.4 categories and 2.3 instances per image. The MS COCO dataset contains 80 object categories. Images in this dataset have more object instances, on average, 3.5 categories and 7.7 instances per image.
39. Its core idea is that,
40. With the progress of adversarial attacks，  随着对抗攻击的进展
41. Although many certified adversarial defense methods have reported substantial advances in adversarial robustness, recent works [19, 9, 3] report that the gradient masking may present a false sense of security, i.
42. Despite a large literature devoted to improving the robustness of deep-learning models, many fundamental questions remain unresolved.  虽然有发展，但是还有很多问题待解决
43. The regularization parameter ( is an important hyper-parameter in our proposed method. We show how the regularization parameter affects the performance of our robust classifiers by numerical experiments on two datasets, MNIST and CIFAR10. 某个超参的重要性
44. **The figure shows the classification accuracy rates (percentage) of ResNet against different attacks (higher is better) on CIFAR-10**.
45. **Since the widespread types of attacks in the real world are very diverse**, the adversarial examples used in the training procedure are often biased.

The proposed adversarial example detection approach is evaluated against six state-of-the-art adversarial example generation methods: FGSM (L), PGD (L), CW (L), AutoAttack (L), Square (L), and boundary attack. All attacks are implemented as “non-targeted” attacks on three datasets: CIFAR-10 [5], ImageNet dataset [6], and STL- 10 [3].
52. In this setting, the adversary **is aware of** the different steps involved in the adversarial defense method but does not have access to the method’s parameters.

 It's a tradition to eat "Reunion Dinner" together for Chinese in the Eva of Spring Festival.  

"Reunion Dinner" is the most significant dinner over the year, and also the best occasion for familiar together, especially for those living in the different city. 

There are diversity food on Reunion Dinner, which implying special meaning. 

For instance, fish never absence on Reunion Dinner due to its tone similar to "Yu" in Chinese. 

Dumpling is also a significant food in the most place of China, because the dumpling stand for wealth and lucky.
